# Workshop on Twistronics and moire' materials: Bridging theory and experiments

Workshop on moire materials, held at the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Jan 16 - 19 2024, Trieste, Italy [Link to webpage](https://indico.ictp.it/event/10456)

The aim of the workshop was to gather world-leading theorists and experimentalists in the field of moiré materials and to create a fertile environment for fostering ideas, promoting cross-talk between communities, and exposing researchers worldwide to the great variety of exotic phenomena in these materials.
One of the most exciting developments in condensed matter physics in recent years is the emergence of moiré materials as a versatile platform to study quantum phases of matter. These materials exhibit a plethora of exotic quantum phenomena, including unconventional superconductivity, correlated insulating states, orbital magnetism, quantum anomalous Hall states, cascades of phase transitions, Chern insulators, unconventional ferroelectricity and superlubricity.

As a result, moiré physics touches many aspects of condensed matter physics, from blue sky research to cutting-edge technological applications.
